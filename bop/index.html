<p>What is Behavior-Oriented Programming (BOP)? BOP is a new paradigm branching off from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</a>. BOP takes the focus away from the data and moves it back to the implementation. How is this achieved? Imagine a namespace had a baby with an interface, and you've got behaviors. Behaviors are the main focus of BOP, called &ldquo;Traits&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Four Pillars of Behavior-Oriented Programming are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicitness over implicitness</li>
<li>Appointment</li>
<li>Inheritence</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; you might say, &ldquo;two of those are from the three pillars of OOP!&rdquo; and you'd be right. BOP is a paradigm based heavily on OOP, taking the best parts of it, but taking away all of the power from data to act since they've been too naughty for too long with that privilege. Data should NOT act, it should have traits assigned to it from the programmer to act on it.</p>
<p>Let's talk about The Four Pillars.</p>
<h3 id="explicitness-over-implicitness">Explicitness Over Implicitness</h3>
<p>This is first for a reason. In BOP, everything you do should be explicitly YOUR choice. You have control over the code and how you use it, not anyone else. This can lead to some pitfalls and the possibility of shooting yourself in the foot if done poorly, that's understood. BOP seek to make this as simple and straight-forward as possible with <a href="#Behaviors">Behaviors</a>.</p>
<h3 id="appointment">Appointment</h3>
<p>Appointment is the second, and thereby one of the most important, pillar. Appointment is how BOP works so well; you take behaviors with traits and have objects appoint them. Through this, the programmer can control what functionality they wish without being impeded. Functionality can be easily removed, added, swapped, and possibly more! BOP is such a new paradigm that things will radically shift in short periods of time, appointment probably going to see the most radical changes of all.</p>
<h3 id="inheritence">Inheritence</h3>
<p>Just like OOP, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)">Inheritence</a> is a core part of BOP. However, instead of with classes it's with behaviors and objects. In BOP, behaviors can inherit <a href="#Traits">traits</a> and procedures from parent behaviors. This, like in OOP, allows for some amazing type-based code structures.</p>
<h3 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h3>
<p>Though BOP has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(object-oriented_programming)">Polymorphism</a> just like in OOP, here it's a bit different. BOP discourages overloading (though an individual language could implement it) but openly allows for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Override_(object-oriented_programming)">Overriding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">Parametric Polymorphism</a>. The reason that overloading is discouraged is that it can complicated the language's ABI and the confusion that implicit overloading causes is not worth it (though of course, explicit compile-time overloading is fine).</p>
<h2 id="behaviors">Behaviors</h2>
<p>Finally we get into the meat of Behavior-Oriented Programming, the behaviors! In BOP, behaviors are essentially both namespaces and interfaces. Behaviors cannot hold data, that's the job of objects, but they can hold traits and procedures. In OOP, the equivalent to an trait would be a method. What's the difference between behaviors and procedures? First, let's explain the concept of object precedence in parameters.</p>
<h3 id="object-precedence">Object Precedence</h3>
<p>When an object has precedence, that essentially means it's more important in the procedure/trait then another parameter. Object precedence is an important concept in BOP. Let's take a car, for example, using Avian:</p>
<pre><code>Car :: obj {
    tires: [4]Tire,
}

Tire :: obj {
    ...
}

Vehicle :: bvr (tires: []Tire) {
    add_tire :: act (tire: Tire, i: int) (
        'tires[i] = tire;
    }
}

main :: proc() {
    car  := Car[Vehicle('tires)]{};
    tire := Tire{};
    car-&gt;add_tire(tire, 0);
}
</code></pre><p>In this example, the car has higher object precedence than the tire, thus the car is the one appointing the behavior, instead of vice versa.</p>
<h4 id="appointment-1">Appointment</h4>
<p>This example also illustrates the point that objects can't act by themselves. The programmer first has to manually appoint the <code>Vehicle</code> behavior to the car's initialization. This is all up to the programmers using the object, and can be used to remove functionality you're never going to use, new functionality, or even choosing from different types of functionality! That's the true power of Appointment, and allows for some amazing things shown later.</p>
<h3 id="procedures">Procedures</h3>
<p>Procedures should not have side-effects. Obviously, there are edge cases to this, but for the most part, there shouldn't be unintended side-effects. If your procedure requires a side-effect, make sure to document it well. Other than that, procedures are just normal functions. All parameters have equal precedence in the procedure.</p>
<h3 id="traits">Traits</h3>
<p>Traits should always have side-effects and have lopsided object precedence. However, traits should only have side-effects on the object that's appointing that behavior. If there's a reason as to why your trait has a side-effect on another parameter, either that parameter should have higher precedence and be the one calling the trait or there's most likely something wrong with your code structure. If there's a reason both of those are false, be sure to document it well.</p>
<h3 id="appointment-in-action">Appointment in Action</h3>
<p>Though appointment was explained a short while ago, here's a practical view of it. This is one of the major features of BOP. Behaviors handle the implementation, all the programmer has to do do is tell the behavior &ldquo;Hey, use this data please.&rdquo; Example:</p>
<pre><code>Foo :: obj {
    list: []?T;
}

BubbleSorter :: bvr (list: []?T) {
    sort :: act () {
        ...
    }
}

QuickSorter :: bvr (list: []?T) {
    sort :: act () {
        ...
    }
}

main :: proc () {
    bubble_foo := Foo(int)[BubbleSorter('list)]{};
    quick_foo  := Foo(int)[QuickSorter('list)]{};
    
    // Fill bubble_foo with data...
    // Fill quick_foo with data...
    
    bubble_foo-&gt;sort();
    quick_foo-&gt;sort();
}
</code></pre><p>This example displays both generics AND choosing different functionality by appointing different behaviors! You're able to use different functionality by appointing separate behaviors, allowing the programmer to decide specific implementations instead of the object itself! The previous example of appointment is very similar to OOP's clunky workaround way of having an abstract object as a member in it, then calling functions through that member, though this is much more elegant and much more flexible (as in OOP this can't be achieved without accounting for it in the class, which removes power from the programmer and locks the implementation away).</p>
<h3 id="casts">Casts</h3>
<p>Casts are another unique addition to BOP. Consider them a structured union of behaviors that allow for templating some members across multiple behaviors quickly and painlessly. Here's an example in Avian (that also shows some more parametric polymorphism!):</p>
<pre><code>Adder :: bvr ('value: ?T/int) {
    add :: act (other: T) {
        'value += other;
    }
}

Subtractor :: bvr ('value: ?T/int) {
    sub :: act (other: T) {
        'value -= other;
    }
}

Multiplier :: bvr ('value: ?T/int) {
    mul :: act (other: T) {
        'value *= other;
    }
}

Divider :: bvr ('value: ?T/int) {
    div :: act (other: T) {
        'value /= other;
    }
}

Modulator :: bvr ('value: ?T/int) {
    mod :: act (other: T) {
        'value %= other;
    }
}

Calculator :: character ('value: int) {
    Adder('value),
    Subtractor('value),
    Multiplier('value),
    Divider('value),
    Modulator('value),
}

Foo :: obj {
    a: int,
}

main :: proc () {
    foo := Foo[Calculator('a)]{10};
    foo-&gt;add(10); // 20
    foo-&gt;sub(10); // 10
    foo-&gt;div(2);  // 5
    foo-&gt;mod(5);  // 0
}
</code></pre><p>See how wonderful that makes adding multiple behaviors together on a single object? It requires very little work and reduces the inherit verbosity with large groups of behaviors.</p>
<p>Instead of having to type:</p>
<pre><code>foo := Foo[Adder('a), Subtrbehavior('a), Multiplier('a), Divider('a), Modulator('a)]{10};
</code></pre><p>You instead simply do:</p>
<pre><code>foo := Foo[Calculator('a)]{10};
</code></pre><p>Wonderful, isn't it?</p>
